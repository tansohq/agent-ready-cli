name: agent-ready
description: "Audit whether an AI agent can find, sign up for, get a key to, use and pay for a product without a person, using the agent-ready CLI. Reads public pages only and writes one fix prompt per gap. Use when the developer asks if agents can sign up for or use their product, asks about agent readiness, agent onboarding, llms.txt or agent signup, or wants to re-check after a fix. Also use when they ask to run agent-ready verify: this skill says how to start it safely."

# agent-ready audit

`npx @tansohq/agent-ready audit <url>` reads a product's public pages with GET requests, shows seven steps (Discover, Understand, Sign up, Access, Use, Pay, Manage) and writes a fix prompt for each gap. It submits nothing, creates no account and costs nothing (it writes only `agent-ready.yml` and a run folder), so you may run it whenever the developer asks about their product.

## If the developer asks for verify

Do not run the audit in its place, and do not run `verify` from this skill. Explain in one or two sentences that verify runs a real agent that creates an account on the product and spends model money, then point to the `agent-ready-verify` skill: in Claude Code the developer starts it by typing `/agent-ready-verify`. You may run the free `npx @tansohq/agent-ready verify --check --json` first and show the plan.

## Run it

```bash
npx @tansohq/agent-ready audit <url> --json --yes
```

- Needs Node 20.9 or later. The first `npx` run downloads the package.
- `--json` prints one JSON document (`agent-ready/audit-report@1`) to stdout. Read `headline`, `steps` (each has `name`, `state`, `basis` and `reason`), `findings` (each has `step`, `title`, `severity` and `reason`) and `files`.
- `--yes` accepts the defaults for three questions about how agents should onboard, and writes them to `agent-ready.yml` in the current directory if that file does not exist. It never overwrites one.
- Exit codes: `0` done, `1` a fix at or above `--fail-on` was found, `2` usage error, `3` the site did not answer. Errors print `agent-ready/error@1` as `{ error: { code, message, hint } }`; tell the developer the message and the hint.

## The three questions

The defaults come from what the product's docs describe. If the developer knows the answers, pass them instead of `--yes`:

| Flag | Values | Asks |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--onboarding` | `try_then_claim`, `limited_until_claimed`, `agent_is_customer`, `agent_identity`, `existing_account`, `pay_per_request` | Who holds the account when an agent first uses it? |
| `--abuse-cost` | `low` (reads and storage), `high` (compute, email, SMS, phone numbers) | What does one abusive free account cost? |
| `--human-before` | `never`, `outbound` (before sending, publishing or charging), `always` (a verified person owns the account first) | Must a verified person exist before the agent acts? |

The fix prompts build toward the chosen model. Say which answers you used and that they were defaults, so the developer can correct them.

## Report it

1. Lead with `headline` ("Your public pages show N of 7 steps working.").
2. List each finding: its step, its title and its reason.
3. Never call a step verified or confirmed: an audit only reads pages. Say how each step was found (`basis`): `observed` comes from a structured file or an HTTP status, `heuristic` from matching page text (it can be wrong), and `not_checked` means public pages cannot show it. Only a real agent run verifies a step.
4. Give the paths in `files`: `files.prompts` (one fix prompt per finding), `files.brief` (a one-page brief for security, legal and billing) and `files.config`.

## Fix a gap

Only when the developer asks: read the prompt file in `files.prompts`, make the change in the developer's own repository, write and run the acceptance tests the prompt lists, then run the audit again to confirm the step changed. The audit reads the deployed site, so a fix shows up only after it is deployed. Never change a product the developer does not own.

## What it cannot see

- Pages behind a login, and pages that render only with JavaScript.
- Docs on another domain. It stays on the product's registrable domain.
- More than 36 requests' worth of pages per run (well-known paths plus at most 14 followed links).
- Whether signup actually works. That needs `agent-ready verify`, which runs a real agent, creates a real account and costs model use.
